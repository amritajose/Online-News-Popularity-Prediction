# Online-News-Popularity

Accelerated growth of online news service and social media have increased the importance of learning and understanding readersâ€™ unseen behavioural patterns. This project predicts the popularity of an online news article and determine whether it will draw significant attention. The model will help to decide the content of articles or the timing of the release to maximize the popularity of the articles.

The dataset for the project is about the Online News Popularity of Mashable articles; the source of the dataset is UCI Machine Learning Repository.The dataset contains 39,797 instances and 61 attributes. The attributes contain both quantitative (like the number of images, number of videos, etc.) and qualitative (like which day it was published and which topic the article falls under) information about the article. The popularity of the article is measured using the Response variable (shares attribute).We want to predict the popularity of a given article based on the given attributes.

The goal of this analysis is to determine the popularity of a news article based on the number of shares or the number of times the article has been shared on any social network or platform.The response/target variable is the number of shares which is predicted using a couple of feature/predictor variables.

The following methods/models have been used to predict the popularity of news: -

1. K NEAREST NEIGHBOUR(KNN)
2. CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION TREES(CART)
3. NAIVE BAYES
4. RANDOM FOREST
5. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
6. SVM (Memory Issues)
7. LINEAR REGRESSION

Both Accuracy and F1 score have been used to determine the best model. The model with the highest value of accuracy and F1 score has been selected as the best model.
